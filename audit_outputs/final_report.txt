1. HTTP Security Headers Summary
-----------------------------------------------

Security Header Analysis Report
----------------------------------
[!] Missing Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
[!] Missing Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
[!] Missing X-Frame-Options (Clickjacking Protection)
[!] Missing X-Content-Type-Options (MIME Sniffing Protection)
[!] Missing Referrer-Policy
[!] Missing Permissions-Policy

Detailed Misconfigurations & Remediations:

[Issue] Missing Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
Severity: High
Impact:
  - Allows HTTPS connections to be downgraded to HTTP.
  - Enables SSL stripping attacks and man-in-the-middle interception.
Remediation:
  - Enforce HTTPS site-wide.
  - Add this header on HTTPS responses:
      Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload
  - Ensure all HTTP requests are redirected to HTTPS.

[Issue] Missing Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
Severity: High
Impact:
  - Increases risk of XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) and content injection.
  - Attackers can inject malicious scripts, steal cookies, or perform phishing overlays.
Remediation:
  - Define a restrictive CSP suited to the app.
  - Basic starting policy:
      Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; object-src 'none';
  - Gradually refine for external resources (CDNs, APIs, fonts).

[Issue] Missing X-Frame-Options Header
Severity: Medium
Impact:
  - Application pages can be embedded inside iframes on malicious websites.
  - Enables clickjacking attacks where users unknowingly click hidden buttons.
Remediation:
  - Add one of the following headers:
      X-Frame-Options: DENY
    or
      X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
  - Alternatively, use CSP:
      Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none';

[Issue] Missing X-Content-Type-Options Header
Severity: Medium
Impact:
  - Browser may MIME-sniff content and interpret non-script files as scripts.
  - Can lead to XSS in some edge cases.
Remediation:
  - Add:
      X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  - Ensure correct Content-Type headers are set for all responses.

[Issue] Missing Referrer-Policy Header
Severity: Low
Impact:
  - Full URLs (including parameters) may be sent in the Referer header to external domains.
  - Can leak internal paths or identifiers.
Remediation:
  - Add a privacy-friendly policy, e.g.:
      Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

[Issue] Missing Permissions-Policy Header
Severity: Medium
Impact:
  - Browser features like camera, microphone, geolocation, etc., may not be explicitly restricted.
Remediation:
  - Add a restrictive header, e.g.:
      Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()
  - Enable only the APIs actually needed by the application.

-----------------------------------------------
2. Open Ports & Services (Nmap Summary)
-----------------------------------------------

The following open TCP ports were detected:

80/tcp  open  http     AWS Elastic Load Balancing
443/tcp open  ssl/http Apache httpd 2.4.62 ((CentOS Stream) OpenSSL/3.5.1 PHP/8.2.29)

General Remediation:
  - Close any ports that are not required for application functionality.
  - Restrict access using a firewall (e.g., ufw, iptables, security groups).
  - Ensure services on open ports are patched, hardened, and properly authenticated.

3. Directory Enumeration (Gobuster Summary)
-----------------------------------------------

Gobuster output file not found.

General Remediation:
  - Review each Nikto finding and verify if it is applicable.
  - Remove default files, sample applications, and debug endpoints.
  - Patch or upgrade any outdated server software or frameworks.
  - Disable HTTP methods that are not required (e.g., TRACE, PUT, DELETE).

-----------------------------------------------
5. Overall Conclusion
-----------------------------------------------

The audit identified potential security misconfigurations related to HTTP headers,
service exposure, directory enumeration, and known issues reported by Nikto.

Addressing the missing security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.) and
hardening the web server configuration will significantly improve the security
posture of the application.

This report should be used as a baseline to:
  - Implement secure defaults.
  - Regularly patch and update software.
  - Continuously monitor and test the application with follow-up security audits.
